  I made separate classes for each operation.  I don't really know what I was
  thinking but it would be a lot simpler if I just made a class for operations.
  After I do this, my next goal is to get user input.  It will be simple at
  first because I'm not that great at tokenizing input.  I'm going to learn,
  though!!
